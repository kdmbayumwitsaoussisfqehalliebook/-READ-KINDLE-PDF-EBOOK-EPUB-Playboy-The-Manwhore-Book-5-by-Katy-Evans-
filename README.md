He needed a good luck charm, I needed a distraction.

Playboy (The Manwhore Book 5) by Katy Evans Book Review

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Love Is A Gamble and He‚Äôs Playing To Win
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018
Review: Cullen Carmichael is a professional poker player. Elusive, commanding, possessive and sexy AF. They call him Playboy. He also happens to be Callan's brother and they have some mutual friends.

Cullen sees Wynn from across the room and knows that she is what he wants, but the timing just isn't right. Their paths continue to cross and finally they get their chance.

Wynn is gorgeous and heart-broken. She is fresh off a four year relationship that was headed no where. All she has ever dreamed of was her wedding day and having a family. Now it seems like nothing more than a pipe dream.

However, meeting Cullen maybe just what she needs to get over her heart break.

This story was a slow, torturous burn (the best kind) that heated you up. Their attraction was no holds barred! These two just couldn't keep their hands to themselves after they got started.

This author is the master of passion and attraction. You feel all the emotions and the intensity between Wynn and Cullen. It was well-written and sucked me into their world. Cullen was easy to fall in love with and I was pulling for him the whole time. We had chemistry but we also had the sweet! An emotional journey for Wynn. He was worth gambling her heart.

Title: Not worth $12.99 (print price I paid)
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2018
Review: Playboy was such a hard book for me to get through. I felt no connection to the characters or plot. Multiple times I wondered if I should keep reading or just give up on it completely. I hoped it would get better. However, for me, it did not.

There was no substance. Characters started off superficial and my opinion didn‚Äôt alter of them at all.

A shame really because I spent $12.99 on it and now it‚Äôs just going to collect dust on my bookshelf, never to be read again.

Title: Cullen is one hot playboy!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2018
Review: I really enjoyed this book and as I was reading it, I keep hoping for more and more even after the epilogue!

Wynn owns an art gallery and even though she has 3 best friends that she loves, she feels lonely since she is the only single person in the group. Wynn's dream has always been to get married and have a family. After wasting 4 years of her life with someone that she thought was the one, he wasn't.

Cullen "Playboy" Carmichael is one of the best poker player around. He makes his money playing cards and has been very successful. Cullen knows that his life is not for many people and know that no woman would accept being with a professional gambler for the long term.

When Wynn and Playboy meets, the sparks are flying everywhere. The banter between these 2 are so hot and funny. The chemistry is off the charts. Cullen and Wynn makes a bet to determine whose career is more interesting by observing each other in their element. Wynn goes to Las Vegas for the first time and she is loving it. And she is surprised by the way that Cullen is treating her by trying to make her feel pampered and not for want of anything. Once they give in to their attraction, it gets even hotter and so sexy!

You need to read this book because Wynn and Cullen are just perfect - witty, funny, romantic, and off the chart chemistry!

Title: Addictive and steamy story
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2018
Review: This is a must read. It's one of those books that you wanna rush to find out more and how it ends but then you wanna slow down and take your time to take it all in so the story doesn't end..I tried to take my time but it was too addictive to put down.

Wynn is an independent woman who owns an art gallery. She was in a long relationship that recently ended due to his commitment issues. She decided to let loose and go on a date to be a distraction. Wynn starts to second guess this date when there showing up to an illegal poker game match., as soon as she spots the guy her date keeps yapping about , she feels like he's stripping her down and feels flushed. The night definitely takes a interesting turn and then realizes who the hot poker guy Cullen is.
The banter back in forth between Wynn and Cullen is refreshing, funny and frustrating all at once,,lol...

I really enjoyed the characters and there journey to happiness. I also liked that we got to read about characters from mogul. I really like when an author has a stand a lone book that still intertwines characters from previous books..

A must read and you will not be disappointed.

Title: Sweet!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2018
Review: Sweet!

Who knew the smoldering Playboy could be so romantic. He‚Äôs ‚Äúall-in‚Äù for Wynn and she‚Äôs just trying to catch up. She‚Äôs got denial in spades all the while she‚Äôs his queen of hearts. (Ok bad poker humor ü§£ü§£).

She‚Äôs going through the motions. The result of a whim, a bet with the card shark himself. She‚Äôs falling hard and fast but refuses to give in. She would rather give it all up than risk her heart.

He‚Äôs swept her away. She‚Äôs his good luck charm. He‚Äôs focused not just on her, but the game. His eye on the prize, she never had a chance. He‚Äôs going for the bracelet and the biggest prize of all. Love.

The ending was sooooo sweet. The man had me melting. I enjoyed Cullen‚Äôs story and the gathering of all their friends in Vegas. Saint and Rachel. Gina and Tahoe. Livvy and Callan. And their future springs up on them. My heart was bursting!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
